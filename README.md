Knowledge with Codes


Why do I start this repository?

1. A knowledge archive on GitHub is necessary for me.

It is not hard to make a problem clear if time is spent on it. 
But typically I forget quickly if I do not use them frequently.
The recalling process will undergo another similar learning process although maybe shorter.
Therefore, taking notes is necessary and GitHub is a better place for archive not just for me.

2. Implementing the knowledge in codes is a way to use that knowledge.

The purpose of knowing knowledge is to use it.
Implementing the knowledge in codes is such a way to use it.

3. Off-the-shelf codes help me and my friends.

I specialize in some domains with some knowledge.
I often feel I can solve and help my friends on some scientific problems.
But it usually takes some time and efforts to make my knowledge ready to use in a way that I am familiar with.
Therefore, it should be wise to output such off-the-shelf codes as the natural outcomes of learning knowledge.
