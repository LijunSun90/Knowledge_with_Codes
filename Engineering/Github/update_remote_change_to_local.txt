https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/getting-changes-from-a-remote-repository

Two alternative workflows for the same purpose.

# Workflow 1: Steps.

# 1. Fetching changes from a remote repository.

$ git fetch REMOTE-NAME
# Fetches updates made to a remote repository
# REMOTE-NAME is the remote URL.

# 2. Merging changes into your local branch.

$ git merge REMOTE-NAME/BRANCH-NAME
# Merges updates made online with your local work


# Workflow 2: Steps.

# 1. Pulling changes from a remote repository

$ git pull REMOTE-NAME BRANCH-NAME
# Grabs online updates and merges them with your local work

# 2. (Optional) Abort merge.

$ git merge --abort
# Take the branch back to where it was in before you pulled,
# if you run into a merge conflict you cannot resolve, or if you decide to quit the merge.
