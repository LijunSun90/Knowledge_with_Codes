# gdb is a powerful debugger for C and C++.
# lldb is a clang debugger.
# clang is a C, C++, and Objective-C compiler.

################################################################################
# 1. Compile.
# "To prepare your program for debugging with gdb, you must compile it with the
-g flag."
################################################################################
gcc -g foo.c -o foo


################################################################################
# 2. Invoke & quit gdb.
# Invoke: type "gdb" at the shell prompt.
# Quit: use "quit" at the prompt (gdb).
################################################################################
# At the shell prompt:
gdb executable

#
lldb executable


################################################################################
3. gdb commands.
################################################################################
(gdb) help


########## file

# Specify which program to debug.
(gdb) file executable

########## run

# Start the program previously selected with the file command,
# or on the unix command line when started gdb.
(gdb) run

# Give command line arguments.
(gdb) run 2048 24 4

# Redirect input/output.
(gdb) run > outfile.txt

########## break

# Set a breakpoint at the beginning of function.
(gdb) break function

# If code is in multiple files.
(gdb) break filename1:function1 filename2:function2

# Set the breakpoint to the given line number in the source file.
(gdb) break linenumber
(gdb) break filename:linenumber

########## delete

# Delete all breakpoints that have been set.
(gdb) delete

# Delete breakpoint numbered number.
(gdb) delete number

# Find out what number each breakpoint is by doing
(gdb) info breakpoints


########## clear

# Delete the breakpoint set at that function.
(gdb) clear function
(gdb) clear filename:function
(gdb) clear linenumber
(gdb) clear filename:linenumber

########## continue

# Set the program running again, after you have stopped it at a breakpoint.
(gdb) continue

########## step

# Go ahead and execute the current source line, and then stop execution again before the next sourceline.
(gdb) step

########## next

# Continue until the next source line in the current function
# (actually, the current innermost stackframe, to be precise).
(gdb) next

# similar to step, except that
# if the line about to be executed is a function call,
# then that function call will be completely executed before execution stops again,
# whereas with step execution will stop at the first line of the function that is called.

########## until

# like next, except that if you are at the end of a loop,
# until will continue execution until the loop is exited,
# whereas next will just take you back up to the beginning of the loop.
(gdb) until

########## list

# Print out some lines from the source code around linenumber.
(gdb) list linenumber

# Print out lines from the beginning of that function
(gdb) list function

# Print out the lines just after the lines that you printed out with the previous list commandã€‚
(gdb) list

########## print

# Print out the value of the expression, which could be just a variable name.
(gdb) print expression

# Print out the first 25 (for example) values in an array called list.
(gdb) print list[0]@25
