* Virtual memory: array of bytes.

* Bytes: 8 bits, each has a memory address. 

1 B (byte) = 8 bits
1 KB (kilobyte) = 10^3 B = 2^10 B
1 MB (megabyte) = 10^6 B = 2^20 B
1 GB (gigabyte) = 10^9 B = 2^30 B
1 TB (terabyte) = 10^12 B = 2^40 B
1 PB (petabyte) = 10^15 B = 2^50 B
1 EB (exabyte) = 10^18 B = 2^60 B
1 ZB (zettabyte) = 10^21 B = 2^70 B

* Word: Why word? "Buses are typically designed to transfer fixed-size chunks of bytes known as words."

* Word size: the number of bytes or bits (1 byte = 8 bits) for a word in a machine.
A word uses the word-size bytes or bits (1 byte = 8 bits) to encode a virtual address and
thus the word size determines the maximum size of the virtual address space,
i.e., 0 to (2^w - 1) if world size is w bits.

1) 32-bit machine: 1 W (word) = 32 bits = 4 bytes,
the value it can represent range  from 0 to 2^32 = 4 GB, thus the max memory address = 4 GB.

2) 64-bit machine: 1 W (word) = 64 bits = 8 bytes,
the value it can represent range  from 0 to 2^64 = 16 EB, thus the max memory address = 16 EB.
