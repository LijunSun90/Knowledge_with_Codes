Implicit Casting:

"When an operation is performed where one operand is signed and the other is unsigned,
C implicitly casts the signed argument to unsigned
and performs the operations assuming the numbers are nonnegative." (CSAPP:2.2.5)

/*
Casting:

ST: first size then type: "the program first changes the size and then the type." (CSAPP:2.2.6)
